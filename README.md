# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in Java

A simple console-based number guessing game built in Java. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

* The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.
* The player has 5 attempts to guess the number correctly.
* After each round, the user can choose to play again.
* The game keeps track of the total score (i.e., number of times the user guessed correctly).
* Personalized experience using the player's name.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Random number generation
* Input handling with `Scanner`
* Simple game loop with replay option
* Score tracking across sessions
* Feedback for each guess (higher/lower hint)

## ðŸ”§ Customization

You can modify these constants in the source code to adjust difficulty:

public static final int Min_Number = 1;
public static final int Max_Number = 10;
public static final int total_attempts = 5;
